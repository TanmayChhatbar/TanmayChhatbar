## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm Tanmay. I'm a PhD student in automotive engineering at Clemson University. Beyond the academic realm, I like exploring the realms of microcontroller-based boards serving my passion for data collection, sim racing and tinkering in general.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

### Microcontroller Projects 🕹️

My projects revolve around ESP32 boards with displays and sensors to serve specific purpose. They're my journey to learn through experimentation.

### Python Scripting 🐍

I have created some Python scripts, ranging from web-scraping to data logging and analysis on microcontroller-based boards. I have also tailored some projects for WiFi-based LED control, and for compartmentalizing photos. These scripts are my toolkit for seamless integration with my devices.

### 3D Animation Expeditions 🚀

3D modelling and animation allow simulation of the real world. I believe it's a gateway to pre-execution verification using 3D animation helps detect bugs in code without loss of real hardware.

## 🌐 Connect and Collaborate

I'm always happy to connect with fellow enthusiasts, learners, and potential collaborators. Whether you're here to learn, share ideas, or collaborate on exciting projects, feel free to reach out.

Happy coding and tinkering! 🚗💨
